        <p>Brazil, a vast South American country, stretches from the Amazon Basin in the north to vineyards and the gigantic Iguazu Falls in the south. Rio de Janeiro, symbolized by its 38-meter-high statue of Christ the Redeemer, situated at the top of Corcovado, is famous for the bustling beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema, as well as the immense and lively Carnival, with parades of floats, extravagant costumes and samba.</p>
